# Intelligent-CPU-Scheduler-Simulator


The Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator is a Python-based GUI tool that simulates CPU scheduling algorithmsâ€”FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling. Users input process details (arrival time, burst time, priority), select an algorithm, and view a real-time Gantt chart alongside performance metrics like average waiting and turnaround times. Built with tkinter and matplotlib, it offers an interactive way to explore and visualize how scheduling algorithms manage CPU resources.
